# publicHolidays
A simple application using spring-boot to make a post API that returns a country's detailed information and their public holidays based on the country and year provided

If unable to get a response, please check that that both these servers are not down :
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/AU
https://date.nager.at/api/v3/PublicHolidays/2024/AU

Do note that it will sometimes fail as the server takes too long to respond, so do not be alarmed
